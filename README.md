# TelegramChart #

Single-activity app. The JSON data is read from the raw directory.
JSON parsing is done with native Android libs.
Night and day themes are implemented with android-themes.
Charts are implemented as custom views with canvas drawing with HW acceleration.
Axis animations are implemented using ValueAnimators and redrawing.
The app supports configuration changes (for example, orientation change) -
all states are saved and restored on Activity recreation.

I would have done the bonus task if we had been given more time.
